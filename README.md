# SAS Content-Aware Copilot: Intelligent SAS Assistant

**SAS Content-Aware Copilot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline and accelerate the entire data analytics and reporting lifecycle. It serves as an intelligent companion for **data analysts**, **ETL developers**, and **BI/MI teams**, offering expert-level knowledge and intelligent automation across the SAS ecosystem.

## üß† Codebase Intelligence

The copilot is capable of learning and reasoning over the **entire SAS codebase**, including:

- Large codebase of SAS scripts across analysis, data management,  ETL and reporting
- Data models, tables, and metadata across libraries  
- Supporting documentation, business rules, and lineage definitions  

By embedding this information into a semantic index (RAG pipelines), the solution provides a unified view of the environment‚Äîtransforming it into an AI-accessible knowledge base.

## üîç Core Capabilities

Once deployed, the copilot enables:

### ‚úÖ Instant Answers About:
- SAS code logic and macro dependencies  
- Table relationships, metadata attributes, and business rules  
- Linked documentation and development history  

### ‚úÖ Productivity Enhancements:
- Accelerated code authoring and validation  
- Smart search and impact analysis across the stack  
- Simplified understanding of complex or legacy flows  

### ‚úÖ Automation of Repetitive Tasks:
- Batch monitoring and error detection  
- Log file diagnostics and resolution guidance  
- Reconciliation reporting and data checks  

## üë• Target Users

The solution functions as a virtual **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** for:

- **Data Management Teams** ‚Äì ensuring process traceability and data governance  
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Teams** ‚Äì optimizing report delivery and investigation  
- **Management Information (MI) Teams** ‚Äì reducing turnaround time for insight validation  

## üè¢ Enterprise Solution

This open-source version is ideal for proof-of-concept, demos, and internal innovation use cases.

For production-grade deployments, our **enterprise solution** provides:

- Scalable indexing of thousands of SAS programs
- Well structured RAG pipelines for semantic search

## üöÄ Deployment Options

The solution is lightweight and can be deployed in various environments depending on your needs:

### üê≥ Local Deployment (Docker)

- Quickly run the app using Docker and docker-compose
- Ideal for local evaluation, testing, and development

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment

- Can be deployed to cloud-native platforms such as:
  - **Azure Container Apps**
  - **Azure Web Apps for Containers**
  - **AWS ECS or Fargate**
  - **GCP Cloud Run**
- GitHub Actions included for CI/CD pipelines

Deployment is flexible, allowing organizations to integrate the copilot into their existing infrastructure securely and efficiently.


## üì¶ Open Source vs Enterprise

The **open-source edition** includes:
- The core **SAS Copilot Assistant** (code and metadata understanding)
- A powerful **Log Analytics Dashboard** for analyzing batch outcomes

The **enterprise edition** expands capabilities with:
- **Automated validation** of outputs and reconciliations
- **Workflow automation** (issue triage, rerun triggers, QA tasks)
- **Integration with Python modules** 
- **AI Assisted Test Automation**
- **SAS VIYA custom flow steps** 
- **CI/CD Orchestration**
- Support for **large-scale indexing** and advanced LLM orchestration

## üîó SAS Platform Integration

SAS Content-Aware Copilot is designed to work with both:

- **SAS 9** (traditional environment): integrates via file system, metadata exports, and log file processing
- **SAS Viya**: integrates via Viya APIs, SAS Information Catalog, CAS tables, Git-integrated pipelines, and cloud-native services

This flexibility ensures seamless adoption in hybrid environments or during platform migration.
This solution can run as a stand alone-application or integrated in SAS flows.
